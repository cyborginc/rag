## 429 Rate Limit Issue for NVIDIA-Hosted Models

You might see an error "429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url" during ingestion while using NVIDIA-hosted models. 
This can be mitigated by setting the following parameters before starting ingestor-server and nv-ingest-ms-runtime:

```bash
export NV_INGEST_FILES_PER_BATCH=4
export NV_INGEST_CONCURRENT_BATCHES=1
export MAX_INGEST_PROCESS_WORKERS=8
export NV_INGEST_MAX_UTIL=8
```

```bash
# Start the ingestor-server and nv-ingest-ms-runtime containers
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml up -d 
```

> [!NOTE]
> This can reduce the page-per-second performance for the ingestion. For maximum performance, [on-prem deployment](deploy-docker-self-hosted.md) is recommended.



## Confidence threshold filtering issues

If no documents are returned when using confidence threshold filtering, the threshold may be set too high. Try lowering the `confidence_threshold` value or ensure the reranker is enabled to provide relevance scores. Confidence threshold filtering works best when reranker is enabled. Without reranker, documents may not have meaningful relevance scores. For optimal results, use confidence threshold values between 0.3-0.7. Values above 0.7 may be too restrictive.



## Deploy.Resources.Reservations.devices error

You might encounter an error resembling the following during the [container build process for self-hosted models](deploy-docker-self-hosted.md) process.
This is likely caused by an [outdated Docker Compose version](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/11097).
To resolve this issue, upgrade Docker Compose to version `v2.29.0` or later.

```
1 error(s) decoding:

* error decoding 'Deploy.Resources.Reservations.devices[0]': invalid string value for 'count' (the only value allowed is 'all')
```



## Device error

You might encounter an `unknown device` error during the [container build process for self-hosted models](deploy-docker-self-hosted.md).
This error typically indicates that the container is attempting to access GPUs that are unavailable or non-existent on the host.
To resolve this issue, verify the GPU count specified in the [nims.yaml](../deploy/compose/nims.yaml) configuration file.

```bash
nvidia-container-cli: device error: {n}: unknown device: unknown
```



## DNS resolution failed for <service_name:port>
This category of errors in either `rag-server` or `ingestor-server` container logs indicates:
The server is trying to reach a self-hosted on-premises deployed service at `service_name:port` but it is unreachable. You can ensure that the service is up using `docker ps`.

For example, the below logs in ingestor server container indicates `page-elements` service is unreachable at port `8001`:

```output
Original error: Error during NimClient inference [yolox-page-elements, grpc]: [StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE] DNS resolution failed for page-elements:8001: C-ares status is not ARES_SUCCESS qtype=AAAA name=page-elements is_balancer=0: Could not contact DNS servers
```

In case you were expecting to use NVIDIA-hosted model for this service, then ensure the corresponding environment variables were set in the same terminal from where you did docker compose up. Following the above example the environment variables which are expected to be set are:

```output
   export YOLOX_HTTP_ENDPOINT="https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/cv/nvidia/nemoretriever-page-elements-v2"
   export YOLOX_INFER_PROTOCOL="http"
```



## Elasticsearch connection timeout

If you encounter Elasticsearch connection timeout errors during ingestion, you can adjust the `ES_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` environment variable to increase the timeout duration. This is particularly useful when dealing with large documents or slow Elasticsearch clusters.

To resolve this issue on Helm deployments, do the following:

Add the `ES_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` environment variable to the `envVars` section in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
envVars:
  # ... existing environment variables ...
  ES_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: "1200"  # Timeout in seconds (default is typically 600)
```

To resolve this issue on Docker deployments, do the following:

Add the `ES_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` environment variable to the `environment` section in your `docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml` file:

```yaml
environment:
  # ... existing environment variables ...
  ES_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: "1200"  # Timeout in seconds (default is typically 600)
```

After updating the configuration, restart the ingestor server and try the ingestion again. You can increase the timeout value if you continue to experience connection issues, but be aware that very high timeout values may indicate underlying performance issues with your Elasticsearch cluster.



## Error details: [###] Too many open files for llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5 container
source: hyper_util::client::legacy::Error(Connect, ConnectError("dns error", Os { code: 24, kind: Uncategorized, message: "Too many open files" })) })

This error happens because the default number of Open files allowed are 1024 for Containers. Follow the below steps to modify the container configuration to allow more number of open files.

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d 
echo "[Service]" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d/override.conf 
echo "LimitNOFILE=65536" | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d/override.conf 
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl restart containerd 
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```



## ERROR: pip's dependency resolver during container building

```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behavior is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
```

If the above error related to dependency conflicts are seen while building containers, clear stale docker images using `docker system prune -af` and then execute the build command using `--no-cache` flag.



## External Vector databases

We've integrated VDB and embedding creation directly into the pipeline with caching included for expediency.
However, in a production environment, it's better to use a separately managed VDB service.

NVIDIA offers optimized models and tools like NVIDIA NeMo Retriever ([build.nvidia.com/explore/retrieval](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/retrieval))
and cuVS ([github.com/rapidsai/cuvs](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs)).



## Hallucination and Out-of-Context Responses

The current prompt configuration does not strictly enforce response generation from the retrieved context. This can result in the following scenarios:

1. **Out-of-context responses**: The LLM generates responses that are not grounded in the provided context
2. **Irrelevant context usage**: The model provides information from the retrieved context that doesn't directly answer the user's query

These issues can be addressed by adding the following instruction to the `rag_chain` user prompt in [prompt.yaml](../src/nvidia_rag/rag_server/prompt.yaml):

```yaml
Handling Missing Information: If the context does not contain the answer, you must state directly that you do not have information on the specific subject of the user's query. For example, if the query is about the "capital of France", your response should be "I did not find information about capital of France." Do not add any other words, apologies, or explanations.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adding this information may impact response accuracy, especially when partial information is available instead of complete information in the retrieved context. The system may become more conservative in providing answers, potentially refusing to respond even when some relevant information exists in the context.



## Ingestion failures

In case a PDF or PPTx file is not ingested properly, check if that PDF/PPTx only contains images. If the images contain text that you want to extract, try enabling `APP_NVINGEST_EXTRACTINFOGRAPHICS` from [`deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml`](../deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml).

You may also enable image captioning to better extract content from images. For more details on enabling image captioning, refer to [image_captioning.md](image_captioning.md).



## IPv6-Only Computers

To use the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint with Docker on an IPv6-only computer, add the following code to your yaml file. For details, refer to [Use IPv6 networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/ipv6/).

```yaml
networks:
 default:
  enable_ipv6: true
  name: nvidia-rag
```



## Node exporter pod crash with prometheus stack enabled in helm deployment

If you experience issues with the `prometheus-node-exporter` pod crashing after enabling the `kube-prometheus-stack`, and you encounter an error message like:

```sh
msg="listen tcp 0.0.0.0:9100: bind: address already in use"
```

This error indicates that the port `9100` is already in use. To resolve this, you can update the port for `prometheus-node-exporter` in the `values.yaml` file.

Update the following in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
kube-prometheus-stack:
   # ... existing code ...
  prometheus-node-exporter:
    service:
      port: 9101 # Changed from 9100 to 9101
      targetPort: 9101  # Changed from 9100 to 9101
```



## Out of memory issues while deploying nim-llm service

If you run into `torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory.` while deploying the model, this is most likely due to wrong model profile being auto selected during deployment. Refer to steps in the appropriate [deployment guide](readme.md#deploy) and set the correct profile using `NIM_MODEL_PROFILE` variable.



## Password Issue Fix

If you encounter any `password authentication failed` issues with the structured retriever container,
consider removing the volumes directory located at `deploy/compose/volumes`.
In this case, you may need to reprocess the data ingestion.



## pymilvus error: not allowed to retrieve raw data of field sparse

```
pymilvus.exceptions.MilvusException: <MilvusException: (code=65535, message=not allowed to retrieve raw data of field sparse)>
```
This happens when a collection created with vector search type `hybrid` is accessed using vector search type `dense` on retrieval side. Make sure both the search types are same in ingestor-server-compose and rag-server-compose file using `APP_VECTORSTORE_SEARCHTYPE` environment variable.



## Reset the entire cache

To reset the entire cache, you can run the following command.
This deletes all the volumes associated with the containers, including the cache.

```bash
docker compose down -v
```



## Running out of credits

If you run out of credits for the NVIDIA API Catalog,
you will need to obtain more credits to continue using the API.
Please contact your NVIDIA representative to get more credits.
